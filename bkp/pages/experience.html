                            <p>After my time in the Air Force, I joined Verizon as a network engineer. The pace was fast, but the goal was the same: to build and manage efficient communication networks.</p>
                            <p>At Verizon, I was more than a team member. I was responsible for designing systems from scratch. This involved creating a comprehensive system that met our clients' diverse needs, from power systems to data routing.</p>
                            <p>As a detail engineer and core equipment engineer, I was responsible for maintaining our systems. This involved understanding the entire network ecosystem, optimizing network performance, and addressing potential issues before they became problems.</p>
                            <p>But my role at Verizon wasn't just about technology. It was also about connecting with people: my colleagues, stakeholders, and clients. Each project was a chance to solve a problem and create a success story.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at Verizon, I was reminded of my mission from my Air Force days: to ensure clear, secure communication. At Verizon, this mission expanded to include speed, efficiency, and innovation.</p>

                            <p>My journey in the Air Force started in Texas with Basic Military Training (BMT). From there, I moved to Biloxi, where I began to learn about networks and communications.</p>
                            <p>At Whiteman AFB, I balanced theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. I was also given the opportunity to lead the Communications Focal Point.</p>
                            <p>In Afghanistan, I was responsible for maintaining secure communication channels, despite the challenging environment. On my way back, I stopped in Kyrgyzstan, where I had a chance to reflect and experience the local culture.</p>
                            <p>Back in Nevada, I continued to work on technical projects, delving into complex topics like cryptography and secure, private networks. In my free time, I expanded my personal hobbies and passions, exploring photography and video game development.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time in the Air Force, I worked with companies like General Dynamics, Cisco, Juniper, and Ciena. I learned about all aspects of networking, from the physical layer to the application layer.</p>
                            <p>My mission was always clear: to ensure clear, secure communication. Looking back, I see that this journey was about more than just technology. It was about building relationships and making a difference.</p>

                            <p>I started my academic journey at New Mexico State University. However, I soon left to join the Air Force.</p>
                            <p>While in the Air Force, I continued my education at the Community College of the Air Force and the University of Phoenix online. The flexible curriculum allowed me to balance my military duties with my studies.</p>
                            <p>When the University of Phoenix was involved in a scandal, I transferred to Arizona State University with just 20 credits left to graduate.</p>
                            <p>At ASU, I focused on security, computer science, and information technology. I was able to apply the practical knowledge I gained in the Air Force to my academic studies.</p>
                            <p>Looking back, I see that each step of my academic journey, from New Mexico to Arizona, has contributed to my career in a unique way.</p>
