                    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Q:</strong> Why aren't there any links to your work?</li>
                        <li><strong>A:</strong> I often complete projects privately and share them with close friends and family. I'm working on becoming more open to sharing my work publicly in the future.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Q:</strong> Can I hire you for photography, web development, app creation, or other projects?</li>
                        <li><strong>A:</strong> No, I've never been "for hire." While I appreciate the interest, my creative skills are personal pursuits. Often, when people discover these skills, they assume I'm available to work on their projects, always without fair compensation. I highly recommend you locate a for-hire professional in the field of your need.</li>
